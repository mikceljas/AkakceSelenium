1 - In the .zip file as .xlsx file
2 - Selenium codes are shared in repo
  I realized you requested usage of Java and didn't have time to convert my process. Therefore i used C# from start and used RestSharp instead of RestAssured.
  The code requires RestSharp, XUnit, NUnit and FluentAssertions as NuGet packages.
  For code to work credentials needs to be filled with a valid akakce account.
  I didn't have time to correct searchbar use, you can see my trials within code as comment lines at the bottom. 
  Therefore the code jumps to the searched page with 'iphone' text and works as intended.
  Console output is in .zip file as a screenshot.
3 - Api tests are shared as screenshots 
  Dynamic variables are used for 'token' and 'BookingID'.
  Which can be found in 'Scripts' area of the related requests.
4 - Bugs are shared as screenshots
  4.1 - In some occasions website loads 'footer' area twice. Can be seen in screenshot
  4.2 - In Followed Items page there are filter shortcuts for brands and some brands are not shown. Therefore Filters sum doesn't add up to total number of items
  4.3 - In Followed Items page there is another calculation error after removing an item from follow-list. Therefore while 'Total items' is calculated as 3 where there are only 2 items left in the list.
5 - Collection and Report is shared as .json files
